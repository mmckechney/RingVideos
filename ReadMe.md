- Version 3.0: Added additional download threading and retry options and (hopefully) better download status reporting in the console.
- Version 2.0: Updated calling syntax to use sub-commands vs flags. Can now also create and download a current snapshot
- Version 1.3: Updated to leverage the KoenZomers.Ring.Api Nuget package to interact with the Ring API
- Version 1.2: The app will also save your settings to a local config file. This will allow you to just re-run the app with no parameters and have it download the videos since your last run.
